A clean Hyprland setup with Waybar, notification center, and essential Wayland tools. Also, easy to swap themes with the `theme` variable in `hyprland.conf`. Only gruvbox is included here, but if you look at the gruvbox theme, you can easily understand how to add more themes.

## Usage

After installing the packages, copy this configuration to `~/.config/hypr/` and start Hyprland.

Applications (terminal, browser, editor, etc.) are configurable via variables in `hyprland.conf`.
